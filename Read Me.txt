This software relies on the Chehra_v0.1_MatlabFit tracker, available at: https://sites.google.com/site/chehrahome/
Please download it and extract the zip file into the directory of this demo.
The tracker should be in its own subdirectory called, "Chehra_v0.1_MatlabFit". 
Unfortunately, this code only seems to work on Windows 64-bit.

In addition, the built-in Matlab function, VideoReader is needed to load the videos.

Please run the setup.m file to include the appropriate paths.

Then run demoHR to test the code.
